# Mina Telegram Alert Script
Work in Progress / Proof of Concept <br>
Not Productization Ready

## Description
Python script to watch a Mina address. 

The script utilizes the BigQuery API so it cannot be 
considered real time but it is a fun way to watch an
address for transactions, etc.

## Improvements
- The docker file needs to be resolved so it works
- Change it over to GraphQL to remove the Google
  BigQuery API dependency
